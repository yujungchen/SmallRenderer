This project is an experimetal renderer for me to use. 
Before "make" the renderer, you need to install glm library. 
Current implementation is verified on Ubuntu 14.04.
(In Ubuntu, you can just "sudo apt-get install libglm-dev".)

Features include

* Thin lens (Not fully verified yet)
* Path tracing with next event estimation
* Supported material: Lambertian, Glossy, Glass, 
* Support scene defined light source (area light)

* Experimental microfacet model
* Experimental dipole model
(However, I am really confused about the BSSRDF parameters. Therefore, I scale the BSSRDF contribution with some hand-tuning scale.)

Guide

* Before make the project, create a new "obj" folder, make clean, then make
